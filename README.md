SYNOPSIS: In lou of the billon dollar powerball and pretty much 2020 thus-far, I figured everyone could use a little more luck. My app will do just that.. 
I plan on  giving the user some options, they could answer questions about their day from which we could extract lucky numbers, or they could use a horescope api to give them numbers or they could have  a random number generator that will show up as a fortune cookie they could click on and it would crack open and reaveal lucky numbers and a small fortune as well (which they could save). i thought it would also be cool if either there was a lucky fact of the day  that displayed and also a link that allowed them to learn facts about luck superstitions and how people attain luck in other cultures. The numbers they saved could be stored and time staped per a time api and maybe give them the weather as well. Of course i'll also wish them luck lol.
